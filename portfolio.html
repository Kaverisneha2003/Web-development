                <h3>Predictive maintenance of machines</h3>
                <p>Predictive maintenance of machines using IoT is a transformative approach that leverages the power 
                    of connected devices to enhance the reliability and efficiency of industrial operations. By continuously
                     monitoring equipment health through IoT sensors, predictive maintenance systems can anticipate failures
                      before they occur, minimizing downtime and reducing maintenance costs. This proactive strategy not only 
                      optimizes machine performance but also extends the lifespan of equipment, driving significant improvements
                       in operational productivity.</p>
